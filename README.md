# Context
A new kind of cinema is about to open in the town of Leganés. Rather than new releases, this cinema will show classic movies that are sure to be a hit among the residents.

## User feedback
What better way to know which movies the people want to see than to ask them? With the user-defined forms, everyone can add which movies they would like to see on the grand opening day of our cinema.

## Optimizing profit
This is a new business after all, so our goal is to have a grand opening that is as profitable as possible. Modelling a linear programming task, Excel's Solver will tell us which movies we should license to have a successful opening day.
